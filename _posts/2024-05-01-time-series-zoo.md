A footnote about computing critical values of distributions.[^critical-values-t] [^critical-values-chi-squared] [^critical-values-f]

[^critical-values-t]: To compute the critical value $t_c$ for a $t$-distribution with $\nu$ degrees of freedom for the purpose of performing a $t$-test at a significance level of $\alpha$, you can use the formula $\displaystyle t_c = \sqrt{\frac{\nu}{I_{2\alpha}^{-1}(\frac{\nu}{2}, \frac{1}{2})} - \nu}$ where $I^{-1}$ is the inverse of the [_regularized incomplete beta function_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_function#Incomplete_beta_function), implemented in Mathematica as [`InverseBetaRegularized`](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/InverseBetaRegularized.html).

[^critical-values-chi-squared]: For a $\chi^2$ distribution the critical values can be computed as $\displaystyle \chi_\alpha^2 = Q^{-1}\left(\frac{k}{2}, \alpha\right)$ where $Q^{-1}$ is the inverse of the [_upper regularized gamma function_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incomplete_gamma_function#Regularized_gamma_functions_and_Poisson_random_variables), implemented in Mathematica as [`InverseGammaRegularized`](https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/InverseGammaRegularized.html).

[^critical-values-f]: For an $F$-distribution with $d_1$ and $d_2$ degrees of freedom, the critical values can be computed as $\displaystyle F_c = \left( \frac{I_\star^{-1}}{1 - I_\star^{-1}} \right) \frac{d_2}{d_1}$ where $\displaystyle I_\star^{-1} = I_{1-\alpha}^{-1}\left(\frac{d_1}{2}, \frac{d_2}{2}\right)$.

This is only very tangentially related to the Dickey-Fuller test but I couldn't find this information online so I'm including it here.

Mention the exact kind of test. Move these footnotes to their own appendix? Link it to the ADF test more closely?
