        <h4>Ocean model development</h4>
        <p>
          My work has involved developing ocean models for climate modeling.
          I am the original developer of <a href="https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl" target="_blank">Oceananigans.jl</a>, a fast, friendly, and flexible Julia package for
          computational fluid dynamics on CPUs and GPUs <a href="#oceananigans-paper">(Ramadhan et al., 2020)</a>.
          Oceananigans.jl serves as the ocean component for the next-generation climate model being developed by the <a href="https://clima.caltech.edu/" target="_blank">Climate Modeling Alliance</a>.
          I led development of the first release and implemented features to turn it into a fully-fledged ocean model.
          I also worked on

        <h4>Capturing missing physics in climate models using machine learning</h4>
        <p>
          Even with today's immense computational resources, climate models cannot resolve every cloud in the atmosphere or eddying swirl in the ocean.
          However, collectively these small-scale turbulent processes play a key role in setting Earth's climate.
          The problem is that they are not well-represented in climate models.
          <br>
          My research combines physical principles and machine learning to improve how turbulence is represented in climate models
          We take simple yet robust models of these turbulent processes and augment the partial differential equations they solve with neural networks.
          The augmented models are trained using resolved simulations of the turbulent process generated using Oceananigans.jl so the neural networks learn the missing physics <a href="#ndes-paper">(Ramadhan et al., 2023)</a>.

        <h4>Southern Ocean dynamics</h4>
        <p>
          I have done some work on bringing in a dynamical perspective to how the Southern Ocean's meridional overturning circulation interacts with the ocean surface and sea ice around Antarctica <a href="#antarctic-siz-paper">(Ramadhan et al., 2022)</a>.
          This was done by inferring surface stress patterns from decades of observational satellite data.
          We also investigated trends that may explain patterns and rates of Antarctic land ice loss and sea level rise.

        <h4>Idealized modeling of the ecological dynamics of marine microbes</h4>
        <p>
          Marine microbial communities lie at the bottom of the oceanic food web sustaining all marine animal life.
          The geographical structure of these microbial communities, and thus oceanic biodiversity, is set by short-range ecological interactions.
          To investigate how these interactions affect biodiversity, we utilized an agent-based modeling approach in which millions of marine microbes are modeled as
          particles that are advected by surface ocean currents derived from satellite observations.
          The interaction was modeled using an imbalanced probabilistic rock-paper-scissors game leading to the reproduction of observed ecological phenomena.

            solving. It is a collection of computational science problems and tutorials taken from all branches of
            the natural, social, and mathematical sciences. Each problem teaches a scientific application (e.g.
            locating earthquakes, DNA splicing) and requires the use of scientific insight and some programming
            skills to solve. Tutorials teach computational methods that students and researchers may find useful

          <p>While Project Lovelace is still in development, we are deploying the website and the problems one by
            one throughout the winter in preparation for a pilot run in April 2017. In addition to the website's

      Molecular movies and geometry reconstruction using Coulomb explosion imaging

        <div class="6u 12u(mobile) text-justify">
          <p>Have you ever seen a molecule bend or participate in a chemical reaction? If so, probably not directly:
            single molecules are notoriously hard to observe for any length of time. For my MSc thesis I developed a
            rigorous computational framework to create movies of individual molecules undergoing chemical reactions
            using Coulomb explosion imaging (CEI), a technique of studying the ultrafast dynamics of smaller
            molecules in the gas phase. While CEI has always promised that atomic structures may be measured, in
            practice no rigorous method is available and instead the momentum vectors are studied. The momentum
            vectors tell a large part of the story but aren't as satisfying to study as the actual structure
            everyone seeks so a method of retrieving the structure is highly desirable.</p>

          <p>The structure may be recovered by attempting to simulate the CEI experiment backwards in time; however,
            solving for the molecular geometries constitutes an ill-posed nonconvex optimization problem that is
            difficult to tackle computationally even for small molecules. I am actively trying different
            optimization approaches and also collaborating with the Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science
            on a fully statistical approach using Bayesian inference. So far the statistical approach seems more
            promising as it will allow for the inclusion of measurement uncertainty which every previous study has
            neglected and seems to scale well to larger molecules <a href="#msc-thesis">(Ramadhan, 2017)</a>.</p>

          <p>The geometries and dynamics of small gas molecules may be studied by Coulomb explosion imaging (CEI),
            providing a means of directly probing the atomic structure and dynamics of smaller molecules in the gas
            phase, a regime where no method is viable. CEI is usually performed using ultrashort laser pulses
            (~10<sup>−15</sup> s) with the goal of "blowing up" the molecule as fast as possible to
            minimize the disturbance to the molecule and ensure accurate imaging of the atomic structure.</p>

          <p>As a proof of principle, we were able to use single X-ray photons from the Canadian Light Source
            synchrotron to study the dynamics of dissociative ionization in the OCS molecule using CEI. The use of single X-ray
            photons led to faster ionization and "blow up" compared to short laser pulses, showing promise for
            greater temporal precision in CEI experiments. It also allowed us to identify a surprisingly rich set of
