    <h3>Ocean model development</h3>
    <p>
      My work has involved developing ocean models for climate modeling. I am the original developer
      of <a href="https://github.com/CliMA/Oceananigans.jl" target="_blank">Oceananigans.jl</a>, a
      fast, friendly, and flexible Julia package for computational fluid dynamics on CPUs and GPUs
      <a href="#oceananigans-paper">(Ramadhan et al., 2020)</a>. Oceananigans.jl serves as the ocean
      component for the next-generation climate model being developed by the
      <a href="https://clima.caltech.edu/" target="_blank">Climate Modeling Alliance</a>. I led
      development of the first release and implemented features to turn it into a fully-fledged
      ocean model. I also worked on

    <h3>Capturing missing physics in climate models using machine learning</h3>
    <p>
      Even with today's immense computational resources, climate models cannot resolve every cloud
      in the atmosphere or eddying swirl in the ocean. However, collectively these small-scale
      turbulent processes play a key role in setting Earth's climate. The problem is that they are
      not well-represented in climate models.
    </p>
    <p>
      My research combines physical principles and machine learning to improve how turbulence is
      represented in climate models We take simple yet robust models of these turbulent processes
      and augment the partial differential equations they solve with neural networks. The augmented
      models are trained using resolved simulations of the turbulent process generated using
      Oceananigans.jl so the neural networks learn the missing physics

    <h3>Southern Ocean dynamics</h3>
    <p>
      I have done some work on bringing in a dynamical perspective to how the Southern Ocean's
      meridional overturning circulation interacts with the ocean surface and sea ice around
      Antarctica <a href="#antarctic-siz-paper">(Ramadhan et al., 2022)</a>. This was done by
      inferring surface stress patterns from decades of observational satellite data. We also
      investigated trends that may explain patterns and rates of Antarctic land ice loss and sea
      level rise.

    <h3>Idealized modeling of the ecological dynamics of marine microbes</h3>
    <p>
      Marine microbial communities lie at the bottom of the oceanic food web sustaining all marine
      animal life. The geographical structure of these microbial communities, and thus oceanic
      biodiversity, is set by short-range ecological interactions. To investigate how these
      interactions affect biodiversity, we utilized an agent-based modeling approach in which
      millions of marine microbes are modeled as particles that are advected by surface ocean
      currents derived from satellite observations. The interaction was modeled using an imbalanced
      probabilistic rock-paper-scissors game leading to the reproduction of observed ecological
      phenomena.

    Molecular movies and geometry reconstruction using Coulomb explosion imaging

      <div class="project-text">
        <p>
          Have you ever seen a molecule bend or participate in a chemical reaction? If so, probably
          not directly: single molecules are notoriously hard to observe for any length of time. For
          my MSc thesis I developed a rigorous computational framework to create movies of
          individual molecules undergoing chemical reactions using Coulomb explosion imaging (CEI),
          a technique of studying the ultrafast dynamics of smaller molecules in the gas phase.
          While CEI has always promised that atomic structures may be measured, in practice no
          rigorous method is available and instead the momentum vectors are studied. The momentum
          vectors tell a large part of the story but aren't as satisfying to study as the actual
          structure everyone seeks so a method of retrieving the structure is highly desirable.
        </p>

        <p>
          The structure may be recovered by attempting to simulate the CEI experiment backwards in
          time; however, solving for the molecular geometries constitutes an ill-posed nonconvex
          optimization problem that is difficult to tackle computationally even for small molecules.
          I am actively trying different optimization approaches and also collaborating with the
          Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science on a fully statistical approach using
          Bayesian inference. So far the statistical approach seems more promising as it will allow
          for the inclusion of measurement uncertainty which every previous study has neglected and
          seems to scale well to larger molecules <a href="#msc-thesis">(Ramadhan, 2017)</a>.

    Ultrafast molecular dynamics probed by synchrotron radiation

        <p>
          The geometries and dynamics of small gas molecules may be studied by Coulomb explosion
          imaging (CEI), providing a means of directly probing the atomic structure and dynamics of
          smaller molecules in the gas phase, a regime where no method is viable. CEI is usually
          performed using ultrashort laser pulses (~10<sup>−15</sup> s) with the goal of "blowing
          up" the molecule as fast as possible to minimize the disturbance to the molecule and
          ensure accurate imaging of the atomic structure.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a proof of principle, we were able to use single X-ray photons from the Canadian Light
          Source synchrotron to study the dynamics of dissociative ionization in the OCS molecule
          using CEI. The use of single X-ray photons led to faster ionization and "blow up" compared
          to short laser pulses, showing promise for greater temporal precision in CEI experiments.
          It also allowed us to identify a surprisingly rich set of ultrafast molecular dynamics for
          the first time <a href="#synchrotron-paper">(Ramadhan et al., 2016)</a>.

    Easy end-cap control in polyyne synthesis using ultrafast lasers

  <div class="project-content">
      <div class="project-text">
        <p>
          The traditional synthesis method for polyynes, an allotrope of carbon with chemical
          structure (−C≡C−)<sub>n</sub>, is a challenging and dangerous multistep procedure that
          provides little control over the their end-caps. Yet polyynes are of great interest in
          interstellar chemistry and especially in nanotechnology as potential elements for
          molecular machines and carbon cluster precursors. Their end-caps may endow them with extra
          functionality and so a safe and controllable synthesis procedure is highly desirable.
        </p>

        <p>
          By irradiating different liquid solvents with short laser pulses, we are able to easily
          synthesize long-chain polyynes and demonstrate end-cap control for methyl caps. Using
          high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), we have confirmed the synthesis of polyynes
          up to C<sub>18</sub>H<sub>2</sub> and methyl-capped polyynes up to
          HC<sub>14</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>. This opens the possibility for controlling the synthesis of
          other polyyne molecules and their efficient mass production

    Synthesis of graphene oxide gels and thin films with tunable properties

        <p>
          Graphene has attracted an enormous amount of attention over the past decade owing to its
          peculiar properties and vast applicability. However, large-scale single layers of pristine
          graphene are difficult to obtain and thus much research has focused on graphene oxide gels
          which may be used to produce high-quality graphene. These gels have their own applications
          too, such as drug delivery and sensor engineering. To satisfy the large demand for
          graphene oxide gels, an efficient production method is highly desirable.

          By irradiating aqueous graphene oxide with femtosecond laser pulses, we were able to
          convert the solution into a gel with physical and chemical properties comparable with
          those of a monolayer graphene sheet. We were also able to control the properties of the

          programming and problem solving. It is a collection of computational science problems and

          problem teaches a scientific application (e.g. locating earthquakes, DNA splicing) and
          requires the use of scientific insight and some programming skills to solve. Tutorials
          teach computational methods that students and researchers may find useful (e.g. solving
