            <strong>What exactly is Project Lovelace?</strong><br>
            Project Lovelace is an open online platform for learning about science and
            developing computational thinking through programming and problem solving.
            It is a collection of computational science problems and tutorials taken
            from all branches of the natural, social, and mathematical sciences. Each
            problem teaches a scientific application (e.g. locating earthquakes, DNA
            splicing) and requires the use of scientific insight and some programming
            skills to solve. Tutorials teach computational methods that students and
            researchers may find useful (e.g. solving differential equations, Bayesian
            inference) and may be required knowledge for some problems.
            Lovelace draws inspiration from similar projects such as <a href="https://projecteuler.net/" target="_blank">Project Euler</a> and
            <a href="http://rosalind.info/" target="_blank">Rosalind</a>.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            <strong>Who was Ada Lovelace?</strong><br>
            Brief mention. Link to YouTube documentary and NYT obit.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            <strong>Where's the best place to start?</strong><br>
            Overview of different kinds of problems. Depends on your skill level.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            <strong>Do I need to know a lot of science and math?</strong><br>
            We try to go for some mathy and some non-mathy problems. Math is unavoidable in scientific computing. But we'll try to give an intro
            and link to good resources so that you can solve the problem on your own.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            <strong>Why make another programming website when there are so many others?</strong><br>
            Project Euler is basically for recreational math nerds. Problems are very well thought out and you can learn a lot, but somewhat contrived.
            Other websites like Leetcode (and many others) just teach super boring and generic algorithms that may be most useful for technical interviews
            but not so much in the real world. Since there are so many interesting real-world/applied problems in all branches of science we think this is
            a really good opportunity to learn both science and programming at the same time.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            <strong>Can I post my solutions online?</strong><br>
            We think the most enjoyable part of solving the problems is that moment when you figure out how to finally solve it. Spending the time
            and effort on problem solving is what makes you a better scientist and programmer. So in an ideal world everyone would figure out each
            problem themselves, maximizing their learning. But people will always post their solutions online no matter what we say, and some people
            can learn from solutions especially after being stuck for a while, so all we ask is that if you do post your solution online that you
            post quality work: well-documented and efficient code that others can learn from by following your code. A lot of our problems are well-known
            and not neccessarily original so there are probably already many solutions posted online for those.
            <br><br>
            To differentiate between users who submit their own solutions and users who copy and paste code we'll be implementing a plagiarism detector
            that compares your submission to other submissions.
